# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for Watcher

This document provides essential context and guidelines for AI assistants working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

**Repository:** watcher
**Status:** Initial setup
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23

This repository is in its initial setup phase. This CLAUDE.md file serves as the foundational documentation for AI assistants and should be updated as the codebase develops.

## Repository Structure

```
watcher/
├── CLAUDE.md          # This file - AI assistant guidelines
└── (awaiting initial codebase setup)
```

As the project grows, update this section with the actual directory structure.

## Development Workflow

### Git Conventions

- **Branch naming:** Feature branches should follow the pattern `feature/<description>` or `claude/<session-id>` for AI-assisted development
- **Commit messages:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature X" not "Added feature X")
- **Pull requests:** Create PRs with clear descriptions of changes and testing performed

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd watcher

# Install dependencies (update when package manager is determined)
# npm install / yarn install / pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run development server (update when applicable)
# npm run dev / yarn dev / python main.py
```

## Key Conventions

### Code Style

*(To be updated based on project's language and style guide)*

- Follow consistent formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing

*(To be updated when testing framework is established)*

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Follow the project's testing conventions

## Important Files to Know

*(To be updated as codebase develops)*

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI assistant guidelines (this file) |

## Common Tasks

### For AI Assistants

When working on this codebase:

1. **Always read before modifying** - Understand existing code before making changes
2. **Keep changes focused** - Make only the changes necessary to complete the task
3. **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't add unnecessary complexity or features
4. **Test your changes** - Run appropriate tests before committing
5. **Update documentation** - Keep this file and other docs current

### Commands Reference

*(To be populated with project-specific commands)*

```bash
# Build
# Test
# Lint
# Deploy
```

## Architecture Notes

*(To be updated as architecture is established)*

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Review changes for potential security vulnerabilities

## Dependencies

*(To be updated when dependencies are added)*

## Troubleshooting

*(Common issues and solutions will be documented here)*

## Updating This Document

This CLAUDE.md should be updated when:
- New major features or directories are added
- Development workflows change
- New conventions are established
- Common issues are discovered

Keep this document concise and focused on information AI assistants need to work effectively with the codebase.
